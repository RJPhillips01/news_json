In a statement issued yesterday (Tuesday), the exchange said without specifying the details that the decision was due to the recent developments in the US market. Beginning August 29, Bistamp will suspend the trading of Axie Infinity (AXS), Decentraland (MANA), Chiliz (CHZ), Sandbox (SAND), and Solana (SOL) for the users in the US. However, the affected users can still hold or dispose of the tokens, the company said. Holding the Tokens \"This means that as of August 29, 2023, new orders involving these assets will be disabled, and all existing orders across all these trading pairs will be cancelled,\" the crypto exchange explained. \"However, we want to emphasize that you will still be able to hold these assets within your Bitstamp account and withdraw them any time.\" Thus, the Luxembourg-based cryptocurrency exchange has urged users to execute any buy or sell orders before the deadline. According to Wednesday's announcement, after the deadline, the trading activities for the suspended tokens will be disabled. Bitstamp, Robinhood, eToro Bitstamp's step to suspend the tokens arrived when several companies were halting some of their crypto operations in the US due to regulatory concerns. Finance Magnates reported in June that Robinhood was delisting the tokens native to the blockchain networks Cardano, Solana, and Polygon. Similarly, in June, the social trading platform eToro delisted Algorand (ALGO), Decentraland (MANA), Dash (DASH), and Polygon (MATIC). This decision was made by the company after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) defined such tokens as securities in the recent lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Binance and Coinbase for allegedly offering unregistered securities. In the lawsuits, the regulator listed several cryptocurrencies which it considers as securities offered by the crypto exchanges. Other cryptocurrency firms, including Kraken, Bittrex, and Gemini, are facing similar allegations from the SEC.

Crypto analyst CoinsKid has highlighted the potential for a significant price surge if XRP manages to overcome a crucial technical barrier. The concept at play here is the so-called Fibonacci retracement level, a powerful tool used by traders to identify potential price reversals and continuations in financial markets. Related Reading: Can Litecoin Bulls Turn The Tide On Recent Declines? A Closer Look In the context of cryptocurrency trading, these levels are drawn on a price chart to highlight potential support and resistance levels. They are calculated based on percentages derived from the Fibonacci sequence, with the 78.6% retracement level considered a significant threshold. If a cryptocurrency like XRP manages to breach this level, it often signals a substantial shift in market sentiment. CoinsKid Predicts XRP’s Potential Trajectory CoinsKid recently provided a comprehensive analysis of XRP’s price action. In a detailed video on his YouTube channel, he emphasized the significance of a corrective phase for the cryptocurrency. According to CoinsKid’s analysis, once XRP completes this correction and successfully surpasses the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level, currently situated at $1.30, a substantial buying opportunity may arise. This development, he speculates, could pave the way for an ambitious price target of $21 by the year 2025. Related Reading: Is Curve DAO (CRV) Price On Track To Reach Or Exceed $1 This Month?

Meanwhile, Gemini, a reputable cryptocurrency exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, has stoked the fires of speculation with a cryptic tweet hinting at a potential XRP-related announcement. The crypto exchange posted on Twitter: Me, the intern, patiently waiting for @Gemini to list XRP. (i want some) pic.twitter.com/I7r7QBjYKR — Gemini (@Gemini) August 7, 2023 While the exact nature of this announcement remains shrouded in mystery, such teases from established exchanges often provoke market interest and excitement. As of the latest update, XRP is trading at approximately $0.639893, according to CoinGecko. The past 24 hours have witnessed a modest 3.4% rally, signaling potential short-term momentum. However, over the past week, XRP has faced a slight setback, experiencing an 8.7% decline in its value. XRP market cap reached $33.9 billion today. Chart: TradingView.com These price dynamics underscore the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market, emphasizing the importance of robust analysis and well-informed trading decisions. The cryptocurrency community finds itself at an intriguing juncture with XRP, as technical analysis and market dynamics converge. CoinsKid’s insights regarding the Fibonacci retracement level offer a roadmap for potential price movements, while Gemini’s enigmatic tweet fuels speculation about future developments.

Hardware wallets and cold wallets are two prominent approaches for enhancing security. In this extensive post, we look into the differences and definitions of these solutions, allowing you to make informed decisions about protecting your cryptocurrency investments. Introduction to Cryptocurrency Wallets Before we go into the specifics of hardware and cold wallets, let's first define cryptocurrency wallets. A crypto wallet is a digital tool that enables you to securely store, send, and receive coins. These wallets are available in a variety of formats, ranging from software-based solutions to hardware devices. Hardware Wallets Definition A hardware wallet is a customized physical device designed to keep your cryptocurrency offline, away from online platforms' weaknesses. In contrast to software wallets, wallets which connect to the internet, hardware wallets add an extra layer of security by isolating your private keys from potential cyber threats. Cold Wallets Cold wallets, on the other hand, are any sort of cryptocurrency storage solution that is not connected to the internet, keeping your assets safe from online threats. Although all hardware wallets are cold wallets, not all cold wallets are hardware devices so if one looks for cold storage tips it’s very important to fully understand how each wallet operates. Paper wallets and other offline methods of storing private keys are examples of cold wallets. Hardware Wallets: Securely Managing Crypto Assets The ability of hardware wallets to safely manage your crypto assets is one of their key benefits. These devices limit the danger of hacking, phishing, and other online threats that can compromise your cash by keeping your private keys offline. Transactions are signed within the hardware wallet, guaranteeing that your sensitive information never leaves the hardware wallet. Advantages of Hardware Wallets Hardware wallets have various advantages over other methods of storing cryptocurrency. For starters, they offer unrivaled security by keeping private keys offline. Furthermore, hardware wallets are resistant to malware and viruses, which frequently target software wallets and internet exchanges. Their user-friendly interfaces make them usable by non-technical people as well. User-Friendly Options Recognizing the cryptocurrency space's wide user base, hardware wallet makers have created user-friendly choices appropriate for both novices and advanced users, meaning wallet options are aplenty. These devices frequently have clear instructions and user-friendly interfaces, making storing and accessing your crypto assets simple. Cold Wallets: Keeping Your Crypto Safe Offline Cold storage solutions, which include hardware wallets, also include various means of storing cryptocurrency offline for added security. Paper wallets are one such method, in which private keys are printed on paper and stored in a secure location. This offline strategy provides an additional degree of defense against online attacks as crypto cold storage. Cold Wallets Explained A crypto cold wallet provides a simple answer to the security challenges that come with internet transactions. It avoids potential intrusions from hackers or viruses by keeping private keys offline. Cold wallets are especially appealing to long-term investors who like to manage their assets in a \"set it and forget it\" manner without neglecting their cryptocurrency security. Offline Security Because cold wallets operate offline, your crypto assets and digital currency are protected even if your computer or mobile device is compromised. This offline protection dramatically minimizes the possibilities of unwanted access and theft, giving bitcoin owners peace of mind. Ledger Wallet: A Trusted Hardware Solution Ledger is a well-known brand in the hardware wallet market. Ledger wallets are well-known for their strong security features and simple user interfaces. These gadgets protect your valuables from online dangers by storing private keys offline. Ledger Wallet Features Ledger hardware wallets include features like secure PIN codes and recovery phrases to better protect your cryptocurrency holdings. These devices are compatible with a wide number of cryptocurrencies, making them versatile solutions for investors with various portfolios. Ledger Nano Series The Ledger Nano series has several models to meet a variety of purposes. Among bitcoin enthusiasts, the Ledger Nano S and Nano X are popular alternatives. The Nano X, for example, includes Bluetooth connectivity, allowing for easy access to your assets via a mobile app. Trezor Wallet: The Ultimate Cold Wallet Solution Trezor is another important contender in the hardware wallet market. Trezor wallets are meant to provide top-tier security while also being user-friendly for both novice and experienced users. Trezor Wallet Advantages Trezor wallets include benefits like as strong encryption, PIN protection, and the ability to store a variety of coins. Trezor wallets are an appealing alternative for people looking for a dependable cold storage solution because of these qualities. Trezor Model Comparison Trezor models include the Trezor One and the Trezor Model T (Trezor hardware wallets). The Trezor One is a more basic alternative, whereas the Model T includes a color touchscreen and enhanced security capabilities. Choosing between models is determined by your security needs and preferences. Choosing the Right Wallet: Hardware vs. Cold Choosing the best wallet solution is determined by a number of criteria. Consider your level of technical knowledge, the frequency with which you do crypto transactions, and the variety of cryptocurrencies you own. Factors to Consider Consider if you prefer the ease of use of a hardware wallet's user interface or the increased security of an entirely offline cold storage option. Your risk tolerance and long-term investing objectives should also play a role in your decision. Best of Both Worlds In the market, hybrid solutions that combine the benefits of hardware wallets with the security of cold storage are emerging. These solutions provide a balanced approach to crypto security by providing the convenience of internet access while keeping your private keys offline. Conclusion Virtual finance and banking keep reinventing themselves, but security is still a major concern in the emerging bitcoin world. Hardware wallets and cold wallets solve this issue by providing solutions that protect your cryptocurrency holdings from online attacks. Hard wallet crypto is generally safer, but whether you choose the user-friendly interfaces of hardware wallets or the total offline safety of cold wallets, the important thing is to make an informed decision that is in line with your financial goals and risk tolerance. FAQs What is the difference between a hardware wallet and a cold wallet? A hardware wallet is a physical device that stores coins offline, whereas a cold wallet is any offline storage option that includes hardware wallets.

Exploring the Metaverse's Potential in Cryptos, NFTs, and Banking Metaverse and Cryptocurrencies Cryptocurrencies are important in the metaverse because they serve as the primary medium of exchange for digital goods and services. In many virtual worlds, digital assets are represented as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and users can use cryptocurrencies to trade, purchase, and sell these one-of-a-kind commodities. NFTs in the Metaverse NFTs have developed as a critical component of the metaverse, enabling ownership of scarce and one-of-a-kind digital goods. Virtual real estate, digital art, in-game objects, and other virtual collectibles are examples of assets.

Virtual Finance Solutions Virtual finance solutions are projected to gain popularity as the metaverse expands. These solutions could include virtual credit cards, digital wallets for managing virtual assets, and identity verification systems based on blockchain for safe transactions.

As this virtual environment emerges, it collides with the realm of augmented reality (AR), blurring the distinction between the virtual and actual worlds. We dive into the augmented reality metaverse, investigating its potential, applications, and ramifications for the financial services industry. Understanding the Augmented Reality Metaverse The metaverse is a virtual shared area that includes several digital realities such as augmented reality, virtual reality (VR), and the internet. As a component of the metaverse, augmented reality enriches the physical environment by superimposing digital material such as 3D models, animations, and data on real-world items. Users can engage with both the virtual and physical worlds at the same time, bringing up unlimited possibilities for entertainment, education, and business applications. Technology is Key In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, continuous breakthroughs hold the key to enhancing hardware experiences and ecosystems, but also to keep building hype around the metaverse. As a pivotal force in integrating cutting-edge technologies, the Extended Reality XR industry, as per a recent Deloitte report, is poised for transformation, overcoming current constraints posed by technological limitations. The XR industry encompasses a constellation of five pivotal technologies, each playing a crucial role in shaping its trajectory. Near-eye display technology, perceptual interaction technology, network transmission technology, rendering and computing technology, and cloud content production and distribution form the bedrock of XR innovation. These technologies are not solitary entities but rather intricate amalgamations or pathways of multiple technologies. Their convergence is essential to cater to diverse application scenarios, notably the burgeoning consumer-centric B2C experience demands. Metaverse Applications in Augmented Reality Augmented reality has already made considerable inroads into the entertainment and gaming industries. Popular augmented reality games like Pokémon GO have shown the possibilities for interactive and location-based gaming experiences. AR gaming is poised to grow more sophisticated as the metaverse expands, enabling multiplayer experiences and collaborative games in shared virtual locations. Real Estate and Interior Design Augmented reality enables prospective homebuyers to visually tour houses, imagining how furnishings and decor would appear in a space before purchasing. Real estate companies can develop interactive virtual showrooms in the metaverse, allowing buyers to explore properties in a shared virtual environment. AR increases the shopping experience by offering virtual try-ons, product simulations, and interactive displays. With the integration of the metaverse, retail firms may establish virtual storefronts and collaborative shopping experiences, bringing consumers and influencers together in shared virtual areas. Education and Training: Augmented reality has the potential to revolutionize education by providing immersive learning experiences that merge the physical and virtual worlds. Educational institutions can construct virtual classrooms and collaborative learning settings in the metaverse, facilitating global education and information sharing. Teleconferencing and Distant Work By providing shared virtual meeting places, the AR metaverse has the potential to transform distant work and teleconferencing. Remote participants' virtual avatars can interact in real time, making remote collaboration feel more natural and engaging. Marketers and advertisers can use AR's metaverse to create interactive and personalized advertising experiences. Companies may improve customer engagement and establish memorable brand encounters by using AR filters and customized virtual environments. Social Networking Augmented reality in the metaverse has the potential to reshape social networking by allowing users to connect and interact in shared virtual areas. In immersive settings, users can attend virtual events, collaborate on projects, and socialize with friends. Consequences for the Financial Services Industry The evolution of the augmented reality metaverse has significant ramifications for the financial services industry: Digital Payments and Virtual Commerce: With the integration of augmented reality and the metaverse, virtual commerce and transactions are expected to grow in popularity. Financial institutions' payment systems must be modified to accommodate virtual purchases and safe digital transactions within shared virtual environments. The metaverse encourages the development and trading of virtual goods such as digital art, virtual real estate, and in-game items. Financial institutions may need to investigate alternative asset management routes and secure virtual asset transactions. Identity and Security Solutions To secure users' digital identities and prevent fraud, the metaverse requires strong identity verification and security solutions. Financial service companies must create novel identity solutions that connect easily with AR and the metaverse. Financial Inclusion The augmented reality metaverse provides chances for financial inclusion by allowing people from all walks of life to access virtual services and participate in the virtual economy. Financial institutions may play a critical role in making these opportunities available to everybody. Conclusion In augmented reality, the metaverse represents an exciting merging of the virtual and physical worlds, transforming how we interact with entertainment, education, and business. As augmented reality continues to integrate with the metaverse, new applications develop, opening up new possibilities for industries such as entertainment, retail, education, and others. The financial services industry must adapt to the advent of augmented reality in the metaverse, addressing issues such as virtual trade, asset management, identity verification, and financial inclusion. Embracing the metaverse's potential in AR can result in transformative experiences for customers and businesses alike, paving the path for a future where the virtual and physical worlds live seamlessly. As technology evolves, financial service providers must be watchful, proactive, and adaptive in order to capitalize on the opportunities given by the metaverse in augmented reality.

Instead of following the conventional practice of allocating a substantial amount of their coin supply for internal use, Rollbit opted for a different approach. This strategy exemplifies the crypto platform’s dedication to transparency and a distinct ideology pertaining to the allocation and application of its money. In the current market recovery, the RLB stands out as the frontrunner, exhibiting an unexpected and substantial surge. The token, regarded as the fundamental element of the Rollbit project, has experienced a notable surge in its valuation, prompting speculation regarding its prospective role in facilitating financial autonomy in the foreseeable future.

The token has registered a 70% gain in the last 24 hours, sustaining an equally impressive 130% rally in the last seven days, data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows.

Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the alternative cryptocurrency has had a remarkable increase of more than 7,000% within the past year. Additionally, its value has skyrocketed by an astonishing 12,000% since its introduction to exchanges during the first half of 2022. Total crypto market cap at $1.14 trillion today. Chart: TradingView.com Rollbit Coin is a GameFi initiative that offers users the opportunity to engage in a variety of gaming activities. The aforementioned categories encompass casino games, sports-related activities, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The platform provides services such as NFT loans, leveraged trading, and crypto futures, among others. Rollbit has just undertaken the migration of RLB from the Solana blockchain to the Ethereum blockchain. This strategic decision was made in response to the increasing demand from users and with the aim of facilitating the token’s expansion and development opportunities. Rollbit’s objective with the migration was to improve the prospects for RLB holders and bolster the token’s market visibility. Rollbit seven-day price performance. Source: Coingecko Rollbit Coin has a trade volume above $39 million within a 24-hour period, signifying a notable surge of 62% in its price over the same duration. Furthermore, the cryptocurrency has experienced a substantial price escalation of 122% over the course of the previous week. Rollbit Coin, with a circulating quantity of 3.3 billion RLB, possesses a market capitalization of approximately $581 million. The significant increase in trading volume of the altcoin RLB may be attributed mostly to its listing on the main cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex. This surge in activity has occurred throughout the current week. RLB: Strong Upward Momentum Related Reading: Can Litecoin Bulls Turn The Tide On Recent Declines? A Closer Look While there is an argument to be made that RLB may be approaching overbought conditions, its momentum remains strong, indicating the likelihood of further upcoming rallies.

Drawing parallels from historical patterns, Olszewicz’s analysis suggests that Ethereum might be gearing up for a significant rally in the coming months. Historical Pattern: Ethereum Forms Ascending Triangle Olszewicz starts by highlighting Ethereum’s current price pattern, jokingly stating, “Ethereum: ascending triangle 450 million years in the making w/fib extensions to $3k.” This ascending triangle, characterized by a flat top and rising bottom, has been forming since May 2022, and if history is any guide, it could be a bullish sign for Ethereum. Descending volume, another feature of this pattern, further strengthens the bullish bias. However, Olszewicz cautions that the “bias remains bullish until price breaks below diagonal support.” He also points out the psychological resistance at $2,000, noting it as an “extremely obvious signal that it’s go time, which should help the breakout.” Related Reading: Valkyrie Unveils Double-Barreled Approach To Launch An Ethereum ETF Alongside A Bitcoin ETF To bolster his analysis, Olszewicz draws parallels from Bitcoin’s past. He recalls, “take BTC in 2015/2016 [the price formed an ascending triangle for 210 days with descending volume] and BTC in 2018/2019 [ascending triangle for 130 days with descending volume] as examples.” In both instances, Bitcoin surged towards the Fibonacci extension levels post the breakout. Ethereum itself isn’t a stranger to such patterns. Olszewicz cites, “ETH has also had previous examples in 2017 (bullish continuation) and 2019 (bullish reversal).” Each ascending triangle pattern lasted 180 days. Both times ETH surged towards the 2.618 Fibonacci extension level. Drawing from these historical patterns, Olszewicz suggests that Ethereum is currently holding the potential to overshoot the 1.618 Fibonacci level and possibly reach the 2.618 level, which translates to a price of $3,800. However, he wisely advises, “but don’t get out the imaginary profit calculator just yet, let’s break $2k first.” ETH vs. BTC: Which One Is The Better Trade? While Ethereum’s potential rally is intriguing, Olszewicz also delves into its performance relative to Bitcoin. He observes that Ethereum has underperformed Bitcoin year-to-date, attributing this to the ETF narrative and Bitcoin’s dominance as hard money. He speculates, “the better trade may continue to be BTC/USD, especially with initial spot ETF inflows favoring BTC.” Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin And Crypto Surging Today? However, if the ETH/BTC pair can break and sustain new highs, it might hint at a runaway trade for Ethereum. But Olszewicz remains skeptical, stating it’s “unlikely based on ETF flows.” Olszewicz also doesn’t shy away from discussing potential bearish scenarios. He’s closely watching certain bearish ETH/BTC levels, including the current local low at 0.050 and the previous inverse head and shoulders neckline at 0.039. For Bitcoin, he suggests a potential move to $42,000, provided it maintains certain bullish conditions. He notes, “as long as we can maintain prices above the midline of the PF & stay in the cloud, we have a decent shot at reaching $42k before halving.” Wrapping up his analysis, Olszewicz envisions a dream trade where Bitcoin breaks bullish first, possibly due to technicals or a spot ETF approval. In this scenario, Ethereum breaks $2,000 but lags behind Bitcoin, leading to ETH/BTC getting “crushed, allowing for an eventual profit taking rotation from Bitcoin to Ethereum”. However, he concludes with a word of caution: “without inflows, we ain’t movin.” At press time, ETH traded at $1,860.

He has become the latest former executive to exit from FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried's firm who pleaded not guilty in January. According to Bloomberg, Ryan Salame, the former Co-Chief Executive at FTX Digital Markets, could take a guilty plea as soon as next month. However, according to the sources who shared information with the publication on the condition of anonymity, it remains unclear whether he will testify against Bankman-Fried. Ditching Bankman-Fried? The other former FTX’s top executives, Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh, have since pleaded guilty to playing a role in the exchange's multi-billion dollar fraud. However, Salame has not been charged in connection to the collapsed exchange, and the details of his plea have not been finalized. Salame could potentially face charges related to the violation of the regulations for political donations. According to Bloomberg, the former executive, who headed FTX’s Bahamas subsidiary, was a megadonor to political parties in the US. He reportedly funded the campaigns of his girlfriend, Michelle Bond, who unsuccessfully vied for the Republican nomination for a seat in the New York Congress. FTX's Political Donations Additionally, Salame is believed to have received huge loans from Alameda Research, the hedge fund of FTX. The Prosecutors in the case have accused Bankman-Fried of allegedly directing his former executives to make political donations aimed at influencing policies for the cryptocurrency space. Besides that, authorities have reportedly traced a private jet purchased by Salame while working for FTX. According to the sources who shared information with Bloomberg, the plane could be surrendered as part of the plea deal or sold to recover customers’ funds. Additionally, Salame reportedly purchased five restaurants in Massachusetts worth USD $6 million after joining the company. Meanwhile, Finance Magnates reported a week ago that FTX had filed a motion to exclude its Dubai-based subsidiary from the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings in the US. This month, the exchange filed a series of court applications proposing a plan to relaunch its offshore operations.

Leading the charge among altcoins are PEPE with an 8% gain, followed closely by SHIB and HBAR both at 6.3%, TON at 5.6%, SNX at 5.4%, and SOL at 5.3%. The overall crypto market capitalization has swelled to $1.18 trillion(+1.63%), while Bitcoin’s dominance in the market has edged up to 50.63%. Why Is Bitcoin And Crypto Up Today? The market’s euphoria was initially triggered by a news piece which was shared by Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas. He conveyed that insider sources from BlackRock and Invesco suggest that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF is more a question of ‘when’ rather than ‘if’, likely materializing within the next four to six months. The source for this information was Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz who made these revelations during a recent earnings call. This news, hinting at the imminent approval of a Bitcoin ETF, sent ripples across the Bitcoin and crypto community, igniting optimism and speculation. Following the news, whale activity has also been a notable driver behind the surge. Related Reading: Record-Breaking $10 Billion Open Interest Fuels Bullish Speculation For Bitcoin Reversal Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, tweeted: “Bitcoin whales opened giga long positions at $29k.” He also shared screenshots of the taker buy sell ratio on BitMEX, ByBit, Deribit and Huobi Global. Each chart shows an extremely high and sudden jump in buying volume, presumably from whales, as Ju said. Ali Martinez, a renowned analyst, chimed in on the significance of open interest. He pointed out that the Open Interest, which represents the total number of open long and short positions across all crypto derivative exchanges, has reached a remarkable year-to-date peak of $10.086 billion. This metric is particularly noteworthy given its historically strong correlation with Bitcoin’s price. The recent dip in Bitcoin to $28,700 seems to have presented an opportune moment for traders to adopt a bullish stance, suggesting that Bitcoin’s price might be poised for an upward trajectory Related Reading: ARK Invest’s CEO Says SEC Could Approve Multiple Spot Bitcoin ETFs Simultaneously Julio Moreno, from CryptoQuant, noted a sharp rise in Coinbase’s premium, indicating strengthening Bitcoin demand in the US. This observation aligns with the narrowing discount of GBTC, which many see as a proxy of Grayscale’s potential success against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its lawsuit for a spot ETF, but also as an indicator of the likelihood of a Bitcoin Spot ETF being approved. The GBTC discount fell to -27% yesterday. From a technical market perspective, the euphoria in the market has led to a short squeeze. A total of $37.19 million was liquidated in BTC shorts yesterday, $65.46 million in the overall crypto market. The short liquidations for Bitcoin were the highest since July 13 when the price rose to its yearly high at $31,820. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that while short-sellers were gradually liquidated while there was a premium on spot markets and funding rates on futures markets were falling. This means that the rise move was primarily driven via the spot markets rather than over-leveraged long positions. Remarkably, whales played a key role. At press time, the Bitcoin price faced critical resistance between $29,900 and $30,000.

To illustrate, Moons is already up 90% in August alone, rebounding from $0.25 and surging to spot rates. Several factors are believed to be fanning demand. One of these is the influence of traders like GCR, who are acquiring Moons and potentially improving sentiment on altcoins considering the recent lower lows recorded in the better part of July. However, looking at how MOON prices reacted after Kraken’s listing on August 7, the community appears more buoyant and confident of improving liquidity. Kraken Listing As trackers reveal, before the Kraken listing, most Moons trading activity was concentrated on MEXC Exchange. On August 7, Kraken announced its listing of Moons alongside Bricks (BRICK). Alongside the announcement, Kraken said users could deposit MOON and BRICK from the Arbitrum Nova network. Moons and Bricks are also available for trading on Kraken and Kraken Pro accounts. From Kraken Pro, clients can trade MOON and BRICK perpetual derivatives. MOON has been described as a “community-driven” token since its launch in May 2020. Within the r/CryptoCurrency subreddit, it serves multiple functions, including rewarding users who contribute positively. Reddit said Moons’ holders can access premium features, including badges and custom emojis, and tip fellow community members. Moreover, holding Moons grants voting power in subreddit polls, affording holders a say in shaping the subreddit’s future.

Out of this, more than 206,000 holders have generated over 670,000 transfers. All Moons are stored on Vault, the mobile-based wallet launched in 2022.

However, according to market analyst Ali Martinez, there is a glimmer of hope on the horizon as Open Interest, a key indicator of market sentiment, has skyrocketed to a year-to-date high. Correlation Between Open Interest And Bitcoin Notably, the correlation between Open Interest and Bitcoin’s price has historically been significant, suggesting that this surge may herald a potential reversal in the leading cryptocurrency’s fortunes. Martinez believes the recent dip to $28,700 prompted crypto traders to take long positions, fueling optimism for a Bitcoin resurgence. Over the past week, the overall crypto market has experienced a period of stagnation, with Bitcoin trading within a tight range of $28,900 to $29,200. This consolidation follows a continuous decline from its yearly high of $31,800, which has also set the tone for other major cryptocurrencies. The lack of significant price movement has left investors and traders eager for a catalyst that could propel the market forward.

Nevertheless, the number of open long and short positions on crypto derivative exchanges has surged to a remarkable year-to-date high of $10.086 billion. This surge in Open Interest is significant, indicating heightened market activity and trader engagement. One crucial aspect to consider is the historical correlation between Open Interest and the price of Bitcoin. This relationship has often been strong, with Open Interest as a leading indicator for potential price movements. As Open Interest reaches new highs, it suggests that market participants are actively taking positions in anticipation of a significant market shift. While the crypto market has been characterized by stagnation and decline in recent times, the surge in Open Interest to a yearly high provides hope for a bullish reversal. Bearish Divergence Signals Potential Pullback For BTC Bitcoin has recently exhibited some intriguing patterns that warrant attention from both technical analysis and on-chain analysis perspectives. According to Baro Virtual, CryptoQuant author and analyst, a bearish divergence on the BTC Average Return Index suggests a possible pullback to $26,000. Simultaneously, on-chain analysis indicates a weakening return index performance alongside a rising Bitcoin price, potentially signaling a phase of re-accumulation that may benefit investors seeking lower prices. The transition of the return index into the negative zone suggests a shift in market sentiment towards re-accumulation. Related Reading: Terra Luna Token Burn Proposal Greenlit – Could $1 Be Hittable? Re-accumulation typically occurs when long-term investors or institutions acquire Bitcoin at lower prices, anticipating future price appreciation. This behavior can be seen as a positive sign for the market’s long-term health, reflecting increased interest from strategic investors. As of the current update, BTC has broken out of its range which has persisted since the beginning of August. It is trading at $29,600, reflecting a 2.5% increase over the past 24 hours. However, the upward price movement of BTC in the short term may not be sustained unless accompanied by substantial trading volume. Several significant resistance levels lie ahead, posing challenges for BTC’s attempt to reclaim the $30,000 milestone. To begin with, the $29,700 zone presents a formidable barrier, followed by subsequent resistance walls at $30,000, $30,700, $31,200, and $31,500. In the short and mid-term, BTC, the largest cryptocurrency in the market, will need a compelling catalyst to push beyond these levels. Without such, a retracement is possible in the coming weeks.

This allowed the bears to gain dominance. However, there appears to be a change in price sentiment during recent trading sessions. Related Reading: Terra Luna Token Burn Proposal Greenlit – Could $1 Be Hittable? On the daily chart, ETH experienced a 2% climb. A positive movement is observable on the weekly chart, although it remains relatively modest. Despite the upward movement, there is a potential risk of waning bullish momentum if Ethereum fails to sustain its price above the immediate trading zone. From a technical standpoint, the altcoin is leaning toward bullishness, with increased buying strength apparent in recent trading sessions. Both accumulation and demand have played a role in this positive shift. Furthermore, Ethereum’s market capitalization has grown, indicating heightened demand during the past trading sessions. At the time of writing, ETH was priced at $1,840. It is currently nearing its immediate resistance level of $1,850, which has previously functioned as a liquidity pocket. Approaching this level might trigger a price decrease. However, if the altcoin successfully surpasses $1,850 and establishes a trading position above the subsequent resistance at $1,870, it could signal a more prolonged period of bullish activity. On the flip side, the support level is $1,780, followed by another at $1,760. Falling within this range might lead to further downward movement in the price. The trading volume of ETH in the previous session was lower. However, the fact that it was in the green indicates that buyers were gradually entering the market. Technical Analysis Regarding buyer activity, there has been increased demand for the altcoin following a notable dip within the past 48 hours. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) climbed above the 60 mark, suggesting a revival for the altcoin and signaling buyer engagement surpassed seller activity. Furthermore, the price remained above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, indicating that buyers were the driving force behind the market’s price momentum. Another observation is that ETH remained above the 200-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line (green). This suggests a substantial price surge could be anticipated before the bullish momentum wanes. Correlating with the increase in demand, ETH exhibited buy signals on the daily chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which signifies price momentum and potential shifts, showed green histograms aligned with buy signals. These buy signals also suggest a potential upward movement in the price over the subsequent immediate trading sessions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Show Accumulation Again, Bullish Sign? Additionally, the Bollinger Bands appeared wide from each other, indicating the likelihood of price volatility, although not overly significant as the bands mainly remained parallel. These parallel bands coincide with the immediate resistance level.

The number one cryptocurrency by market cap might try another run north of critical resistance, but recent data points towards further sideways price action. Related Reading: Terra Luna Token Burn Proposal Greenlit – Could $1 Be Hittable? As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $29,400 with a 2% profit in the past day. Over the past week, the cryptocurrency has recorded similar profits while the rest of the market stalls or sees losses. Key resistance stands at around $30,000, but BTC failed to breach it on every recent occasion. Bitcoin Price Prepares… For Monotony? Over the past two years, the Bitcoin price has been moving in tandem with macroeconomic forces. In particular, BTC reacts to the tension from the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) and its interest rates hike program. The financial institution is entering a quiet period due to summer vacations. As a result, according to crypto analysis firm Blofin, Bitcoin and the crypto market will likely stay within their current range until September. Over this period, price movements and volatility spikes will continue to decline as the low liquidity environment impacts price action, and institutions hedging their positions impact volatility, Blofin stated. Furthermore, the report claims that potential interest rate hikes are “somewhat priced in” and could be inefficient in propelling BTC above $30,000. The current macroeconomic landscape could persist until May 2023 as inflation, the key reason behind the interest rates hike, becomes sticky. The above could translate into sideways price action until that period or until the U.S. Fed decides to cut interest rates paving the way for more risk appetite across the sector. Blofin stated: (…) investors seem to have become accustomed to daily life at high interest rates. The lack of liquidity has left investors with little interest in “trading”. Most investors are sitting on the sidelines. Bitcoin Investors Brace For Impact The chart below shows monthly trading volume across crypto exchanges has declined since July 2022. The report stated that this status quo reflects investors’ lack of interest in crypto, with BTC recording intraday price movements of around 0.1%, a first for the cryptocurrency in such an extended period. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Show Accumulation Again, Bullish Sign? In that sense, the crypto research firm believes that, due to the lack of strength around BTC and ETH, prices are likely to see a dip: (…) it is not difficult to find that when the price of BTC is around $30,000, and the price of ETH is around $2,000, both will lose further upward momentum here, hovering for a while, and then fall. The time to hit both levels was short or long, but further price breakouts did not occur.

According to the city’s chief regulatory agency, some cryptocurrency trading platforms have been making erroneous claims about meeting the regulatory requirements for digital assets. Investors Beware Of False Claims From Crypto Firms The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the chief regulatory body of Hong Kong, released the alert on August 7. In the statement, the commission noted that some unlicensed exchanges in the city were engaging in “improper practices.” Related Reading: Valkyrie Unveils Double-Barreled Approach To Launch An Ethereum ETF Alongside A Bitcoin ETF According to the body, unlicensed Virtual Assets Trading Platforms (VATPs) are falsely claiming to have submitted license applications to the body, which would enable them to conduct transactions legally in the special administrative region of China. Such fraudulent claims were designed to “give the public a false sense of assurance” and were targeted at “inducing another person to trade in virtual assets.” Making such claims amounts to a punishable offense under the city’s Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Finance Ordinance, the regulatory body said. Furthermore, the SFC will consider any likely misrepresentation made by an unlicensed Virtual Asset Trading Platform when deciding whether or not to grant them a license. The SFC may view as unfavorable any non-compliant actions that would need the reversion of client withdrawal or transactions that could have been reasonably avoided. The Securities and Futures Commission said it will evaluate a Virtual Asset Trading Platform’s application based on its ability to show genuine intention to correct previous non-compliant actions, including the gradual unwinding of impermissible transactions. Virtual Assets Trading Platforms that do not meet the agency’s requirements must make efforts to meet the regulatory and legal obligations of licensed VAPTs, the SFC clarified. Total market cap recovers to $1.133 trillion | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com Hong Kong’s Regulatory Framework Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) recently released guidelines for Virtual Asset Trading Platform operators in the country to provide more regulatory certainty for the crypto industry in the country and help protect investors’ interests. The SFC laid down rules that would enable centralized exchanges to provide services to retail clients, provided they are authorized by a license obtained from the Securities and Futures Commission. Under Hong Kong’s VASP regime, which kickstarted on June 1, 2023, a one-year grace period commencing from June 1, 2023, allowed exchanges with an existing large presence in the city to continue operations while making changes to their businesses to ensure compliance with the new SFCs rules. Related Reading: PayPal’s PYUSD Launch Triggers Calls For Stablecoin Bill Platform operators that had not commenced operations before June 1, 2023, had to be SFC-licensed before they could operate. However, it seems that certain exchanges are already violating the rules provided under the new regime. According to SFC, investors participating in trading on unregulated virtual asset exchanges are likely to face “losing their entire investment” on the exchange if it “ceases operation, collapses, is hacked,” or “suffers from any misappropriation of assets.” Following this, many exchanges have publicly pledged to submit licensing applications with the SFC, including Huobi and OKX, two popular exchanges in Asia.

Deviation From The Norm For Spot Bitcoin ETFs In a recent interview with Bloomberg on August 7, Cathie Wood shared her insight that the SEC might opt for a groundbreaking strategy by approving more than one Bitcoin ETF at the same time. Related Reading: PayPal’s PYUSD Launch Triggers Calls For Stablecoin Bill Wood’s assertion, “I think the SEC, if it’s going to approve a Bitcoin ETF, will approve more than one at once,” has captured attention, especially given her prior assurance that her firm would lead in securing approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Wood’s projection deviates from the conventional practice of sequential ETF approvals. By envisioning a simultaneous approval scenario, she introduces a novel approach that could streamline the regulatory process. This potential shift aims to foster a balanced and inclusive investment landscape, catering to an expected demand of over $50 billion. Implications For The Cryptocurrency Industry Historically, the SEC has not granted approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs, while permitting the listing of ETFs tied to crypto futures. Wood’s forward-looking statement emerges amidst a surge in applications from major players like BlackRock Inc, Fidelity, WisdomTree, VanEck, and Invesco, all vying for the approval of similar crypto ETFs as ARK. Wood’s forecast also emphasizes the significance of strategic marketing. Given the anticipated resemblance among various funds, Wood suggests that issuers’ marketing prowess will be crucial in setting them apart as a race for dominance is expected. This insight underscores the competitive edge sought by applicants in a rapidly evolving sector. BTC price recovers as positive sentiment grows | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com As Cathie Wood’s prediction reverberates through the financial realm, industry observers await SEC’s response. With a significant deadline for ARK’s application looming on August 13, amidst speculation of potential delays, Wood suggested that the deadline might pass and be extended but then the date will be eagerly waited on. Although Ark Invest filed for its spot Bitcoin ETFs application on May 15, earlier than others like BlackRock who filed its application on June 15, this was thought to be a race for winners or losers according to Cathie’s “first in line” phrase to favor Ark Invest. However, her revised view makes the race for Spot Bitcoin ETFs and SEC ruling more interesting. This innovative forecast accentuates the intersection of forward-thinking and regulatory dynamics, highlighting an era where digital assets are increasingly integrated within traditional financial frameworks, especially the recent push for ETFs.

Wood also reportedly bought $100,000 worth of Bitcoin years ago when it was sold for $250 apiece and the CEO revealed that she has never sold a single BTC.

As a result, Historical Volatility in the 6W BTCUSD chart has fallen to the second lowest ever reading. The last time this signal appeared, it awakened a behemoth rally. Prices soared in the short- and long-term. Keep reading to find out by how much. Low Volatility Suggests Behemoth Bitcoin Rally Could Be Coming NewsBTC has extensively covered the lack of volatility in Bitcoin using the Bollinger Bands. The Bollinger Bands are part of a trend-following, band-breakout trading system that also can be used to measure volatility. But it’s not the only way to read it. Other volatility metrics include Implied Volatility, which uses the VIX to potentially predict future volatility, and Historical Volatility (HV). HV, just like it sounds, looks at volatility from the past. Related Reading: Why Low Volatility Bitcoin Could Last A Lot Longer The 6W Historical Volatility in BTCUSD is now at its second-lowest level ever. This is important because when an extended sideways phase ends, it ends by awakening a monster rally or decline. Historical Volatility is the second lowest ever | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Is Another Monster 4,000% Move In BTCUSD Possible Considering it’s only happened once before, the sample size is too small to come to a conclusion about which direction prices might head. However, the last time the 6W Historical Volatility got this low, and then broke out, the direction was up. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bollinger Bands Are The Tightest Ever, What Happens Next? Not only was it up, but it was an immediate more than 60% move higher in a single 6W candle. The move that began around March 2016 also kicked off a more than year-long bull market that ended with more than 4,000% ROI following the period of inactivity. The power of volatility once it returns to an asset long trending sideways cannot be understated. Another 4,000% is unlikely after seven years of adoption, but something massive is waking up regardless of the final numbers and direction. Tony is the author of the CoinChartist (VIP) newsletter.

To this end, a crypto analyst, Lark Davis, has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to share his forecast around the next bull market. What Could Happen If History Repeats Itself All of the previous Bitcoin bull markets have always begun after the BTC halving event which cuts block rewards in half. However, this time around, there have been dissenting views regarding the digital asset’s tendency to follow this established trend once more due to deviations in various Bitcoin metrics. But Davis has shared a possible scenario for BTC if the bull market begins after the rally once more. Related Reading: Litecoin Hashrate Taps New All-Time High, Will LTC Price Follow Suit? In the chart shared by the analyst on X, he points out a long period of accumulation. This is when investors fill up their bags with BTC as it is possibly the lowest that the price of the digital asset would get during the bear market. BTC could reach $180,000 if the bull market follows halving cycle | Source: Lark Davis on X Next comes the Bitcoin halving event, at which time, the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the market start to pick up steam. This is when the bull market starts to take shape, leading to the next part of the trend which is when prices explode. In Davis’ post, he shows that the price of the digital asset could rise as high as $180,000 during this time. If the cryptocurrency does touch this price mark, it would mean that the price of BTC would almost triple from its current all-time high of $69,000. How This Can Happen For Bitcoin As clarified by the analyst in his X post, for any of this to happen, it would mean that BTC would have to completely follow the trends of the previous bull cycles. This would mean the bottom could likely be reached in early 2024, but it would also be the same year for the start of the bull run. Even if Bitcoin does follow this trend though, it would not always be ‘up-only’ for the market. It would mean that the bull market would top out sometime in 2025 and then there would likely be a market crash that sends BTC spiraling in the following year. As Davis points out, the digital asset could tumble 70% to reach $50,000 again. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Could Break Above $2,000 If This Happens However, even with the obvious bear market that would follow this trend, it is still an incredibly bullish scenario for Bitcoin and the crypto market at large. The bull market would last around one year, following historical data, providing ample opportunity for investors to make the most of the market. The next Bitcoin halving is expected to take place in April 2024, and if history is anything to go by, this is around when the bull market should be expected to start back up.

Crypto Community Adverse to Paxos Wallet Freeze Feature The PYUSD stablecoin issued by Paxos has a condition that is not too welcomed by the crypto community, which has dulled the initial excitement for the launch of the PayPal stablecoin. According to reports, Paxos, a blockchain infrastructure firm that issued the PYUSD has several centralization issues which give them a certain amount of control over user’s wallets. Related Reading: Valkyrie Unveils Double-Barreled Approach To Launch An Ethereum ETF Alongside A Bitcoin ETF Information published on its GitHub account reveals that Paxos can freeze or suspend users’ wallets and transfer functions on PYUSD authorization in the case of a security threat. The Paxos freeze feature is quite similar to Tether’s USDT which is able to freeze/blacklist users’ addresses involved in fraudulent activities. Additionally, Paxos can withhold users’ funds and assets, as well as wipe the account clean if the law requires it. The reactions from the crypto community were instant and not too favorable as investors’ anxiety spiked at the thought of possibly losing their substantial digital assets or having their wallets on lock. Centralization has always been a touchy subject for the crypto community as decentralized networks are often believed to be more secure and distribute control among network participants rather than a central body. Paxos has stated that freezing accounts is unlikely to happen often, and the company itself would not execute the process. Stock price holds above $62 following stablecoin launch | Source: PayPal Holdings, Inc. on Tradingview.com PayPal Launches PYUSD Stablecoin Global payment giant PayPal recently unveiled its latest innovation, the PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin, on August 7, in collaboration with Paxos, a New-York based blockchain infrastructure company. The news comes as a significant development for the Paxos ecosystem, as the integration of cryptocurrencies into the financial industry continues to grow. The crypto community has largely welcomed this new development, as investors and traders are gearing up to take advantage of the token and its conveniences. Analysts also predict that popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum prices will also benefit significantly from the new stablecoin. The PYUSD is an ERC-20 token developed on the Ethereum blockchain backed by the US dollar. Launching PayPal’s stablecoin is expected to help make crypto trading and offerings easily accessible on the payment platform.

President and CEO of PayPal, Dan Schulman, commented, “The shift toward digital currencies requires a stable instrument that is both digitally native and easily connected to fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. Our commitment to responsible innovation and compliance, and our track record delivering new experiences to our customers, provides the foundation necessary to contribute to the growth of digital payments through PayPal USD.” Featured image from HowStuffWorks, chart from Tradingview.com","title":"Can PayPal’s PYUSD Be Frozen In Your Wallet Like Tether’s USDT?","tags":["LOCATION_United_States","ASSET_TYPE_Utility_Token_U_3","OTHER_ICO","COIN_USDT","CONTINENT_North_America","SECTOR_Finance_FIN_3"],"sentiment":{"title":-0.0409,"summary":0.1858,"content":0.1429},"score":1,"og_metadata":{"site_name":"NewsBTC","image":"https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PayPal-stablecoin-PYUSD.jpeg?fit=1600%2C900","description":"PayPal and Paxos dominated the news cycle on Monday with the announcement of the launch of the PayPal (PYUSD) stablecoin, but concerns have been raised","title":"Can PayPal’s PYUSD Be Frozen In Your Wallet Like Tether’s USDT?","type":"article","url":"https://www.newsbtc.com/stablecoin/can-pyusd-be-frozen-in-your-wallet/"}},{"id":"https://cryptoslate.com/?post_type=crypto_insight&p=348475","link":"https://cryptoslate.com/insights/inflationary-trends-in-the-spotlight-u-s-awaits-crucial-cpi-data-this-week/","publication_datetime":1691532018000,"source":"cryptoslate","image_url":"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/themes/cryptoslate-2017/images/logo.png","logo_url":"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/themes/cryptoslate-2017/images/logo.png","main_image_url":"news-images/1d45885e-c44c-444e-8288-6e94f89c491e.jpeg","summary":"Quick Take Thursday’s upcoming US CPI data is expected to confirm inflationary pressures persisting well beyond the 2% target, indicating an economy where prices are rising faster than anticipated.

According to data from TokenUnlocks, Sandbox will release 332.55 million SAND tokens into circulation on August 14, representing 16.16% of the token’s maximum supply. New SAND Tokens In 2023 To Rise Over 700 Million With the upcoming SAND release, the total number of new SAND tokens in 2023 is expected to rise to 705.3 million. This latest unlock will add to the 372.75 million SAND released earlier during the last token unlock in February. Based on more data from Token Unlocks, the newly released tokens will be allocated to various parties, including the Sandbox’s development team, project advisors, strategic and seed investors, and the project’s reserve. SAND functions as the utility token of the Sandbox metaverse, serving as the platform’s payment medium and governance token. According to its design, SAND is expected to undergo a token unlock every six months until 2025. Currently, the number of circulating SAND tokens is 2.05 billion, representing 68.6% of SAND’s total supply. With the projected release on August 14, these figures are expected to jump to 2.39 billion and 84.76%, respectively. SAND trading at $0.40 on the daily chart | Source: SANDUSD chart on Tradingview.com Related Reading: Massive Token Unlock: Ripple Releases One Billion XRP From Escrow Potential Impact of Token Release on SAND’s Price Token unlocks are common events in the crypto space, usually accompanied by fears of a bearish market. This is because the sudden introduction of massive tokens to the market creates a higher supply-to-demand ratio, which drives down asset prices. Looking at on-chain data, this is one likely effect of SAND’s upcoming token unlock on its market price due to declining network growth on the Sandbox platform. Based on data from blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, the number of new addresses on Sandbox is down by 66.87% in the last month, falling from a peak of 649 in July to its current value of 215. The continuance of this trend means Sandbox may lack the necessary traction to counter the upcoming inflationary pressure, which may ultimately lead to a fall in price. Source: IntoTheBlock Related Reading: Aptos (APT) Gains By 10% Ahead Of July Token Release Following SAND’s last token release on February 14, SAND’s price movement was fairly positive, opening at $0.68 to trade as high as $0.72 and close at $0.71. In the subsequent days, SAND would record more gains, reaching a market value of $0.88 on Feb 20. While token unlocks are widely expected to precipitate bearish pressure, their effects are still unpredictable.

The “halving” here refers to an event where the block rewards of Litecoin are permanently cut in half. Litecoin Long-Term Holders Sold During Price Surge Before The Halving According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the long-term holders had been well-prepared for the “sell the news” halving event. The “long-term holders” (LTHs) generally include all investors who have been holding onto their coins since at least six months ago. Related Reading: These Bitcoin Metrics Are At Important Retests, Will Bullish Trend Prevail? This group includes some of the most resolute investors in the Litecoin market, who don’t easily react to whatever is going in on in the wider sector, as they usually hold through FUD or profit-taking opportunities without participating in any significant selling. Because of how rare movements from these investors can be, the few times that they do sell can be the ones to watch out for, as they may spell trouble for the market. A way to gauge whether the LTHs are participating in selling or not is through the “holding time of transacted coins” metric, which tells us about the average amount of time that coins being transferred on the blockchain had been dormant prior to this movement. When the value of this metric is high, it means that the age of coins being sold on the network is high, which can naturally be a sign that the LTHs are active right now. On the other hand, low values usually indicate that the short-term holders (STHs) are the ones selling currently. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Litecoin holding time of transacted coins over the past few months: The value of the metric seems to have been relatively low in recent days | Source: IntoTheBlock on X As you can see in the above graph, the Litecoin holding time of transacted coins spiked back in June, when the price of the cryptocurrency had been observing a sharp rally. During the largest of these spikes, the indicator’s value had exceeded 1 year, implying that some of the most experienced investors in the market had broken their silence. This rally had occurred as the market had started getting hyped about the halving, which was only a month and a half away at that point. This event takes place every four years, with the latest one having occurred just earlier this month. Unlike what some may have hoped for, the event didn’t prove to be bullish for LTC, as the aforementioned rally didn’t last for too long and the cryptocurrency only declined in the remaining leadup to the halving, until finally it actually sharply plunged on the day of the event itself. It would appear that the experienced LTHs had already predicted something like this may happen, so they had taken the wise decision of selling while the opportunity was there.

In the post-halving selloff, the indicator’s value has remained low, implying that it’s only the short-term holders who have been panic selling after they saw that a bullish trend couldn’t return to Litecoin with the event. LTC Price At the time of writing, Litecoin is trading around $84, down 8% in the last week.

Hedera briefly broke through the one-month-long $0.5 resistance, climbing above $0.6, while top coins like Bitcoin bleed with losses. Even though the overall crypto market cap gain affected many assets positively, HBAR owes most of its gains to the latest ecosystem developments and partnerships. HBAR Price Performance Amid Impressive Ecosystem Updates Despite a drop in trading volume, HBAR has soared over 6%, attaining a peak of $0.06032 on Tuesday morning. This sharp spike represents a nearly 10% increase from the day low of $0.05483. But the token has now receded from its peak value and currently trades at $0.05951. Related Reading: Valkyrie Unveils Double-Barreled Approach To Launch An Ethereum ETF Alongside A Bitcoin ETF Moreover, the HBAR price has soared over 16% in a week, bucking the bearish trend that snatched all of Bitcoin and Ethereum’s past week’s gains. The token’s value is now over 22% higher than the price recorded 30 days ago. However, HBAR’s trading volume is south of its price trajectory. The over 16% decline in 24-hour trading volume raises questions about whether the bulls had reached saturation and capitulated to the bears even before the rally grew strong. Strategic Partnerships Drive HBAR’s Rally Hedera’s network advancements and strategic partnerships have helped to boost HBAR’s current market position. In August, the Hedera network recorded notable deals with leading banking and financial institutions and automobile companies. On August 2, Korean automobile firms Hyundai and KIA announced the launch of a new blockchain and AI-powered Supplier co2 Emission Monitoring System (SCEMS) on the Hedera network. This integration allows Hedera to record the carbon emission data from suppliers while AI will predict future emissions following the data provided. Similarly, on August 4, Hedera announced a partnership with FreshSupplyCoAu in a groundbreaking move that could reshape the digital finance landscape. The strategic partnership allows users to connect with conventional banking and the Mastercard network for a seamless, safe, and wider range of cross-border payments. Through Mastercard’s payment gateway, Hedera will connect traditional banking infrastructure with decentralized finance technology, bridging the gap between blockchain and traditional finance. These strategic partnerships mark significant milestones for the network. They could boost HBAR’s usability and trading activity as more investors adopt the token. This move could amplify HBAR’s reach and market presence, potentially increasing network activities and the token’s price. HBAR Market Outlook, Will The Bulls Sustain? Hedera’s dwindling 24-hour trading volume, however, raises questions about the longevity of the ongoing rally since a trading volume decline often signifies bearish market activities. The HBAR’s price chart reveals that technical indicators suggest a bearish trend reversal for HBAR as the token trades above the 50-day moving average, confirming the bullish momentum on its price today. But the Relative Strength Index has receded from 62 to 57, demonstrating weakening momentum as buyers exit the market.

This observation shows HBAR could face downturns in the next few hours unless the bulls regain control.

The Managing Partner of ‘The Deaton Law Firm’ says he is willing to bet big on the exchange emerging victorious on appeal. Founded Belief Or Mere Speculation? John Deaton’s willingness to bet on an uncertain court judgment follows a recent thread penned by digital asset enthusiast and Australian-based lawyer Bill Morgan. According to the thread, Judge Analisa Torres did not err in her summary judgment decision. Related Reading: Valkyrie Unveils Double-Barreled Approach To Launch An Ethereum ETF Alongside A Bitcoin ETF Morgan was of the opinion that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) classified sales of XRP by Ripple into three unique classes; institutional sales, programmatic sales, and other XRP distributions. Following the classification, Judge Torres evaluated each class by applying the popular Howey test. After evaluation, the Judge discovered major differences in each class. For instance, the Judge discovered that every institutional investor signed agreements with Ripple and expected to earn profits from the firm’s activities. While institutional investors entered contracts with Ripple, programmatic sales on exchanges did not require the signing of contracts, and purchasers, therefore, did not expect to make profits directly from Ripple’s efforts. Therefore, according to Morgan, Judge Torres ruled that the sale of XRP to institutional investors amounted to a sale of securities, while that of programmatic sales on virtual exchanges was not.

Recently, US District Judge Jed Rakoff, who oversees the SEC’s lawsuit against Terraform Labs, rejected the approach used in Judge Torres’s ruling. This creates a certain unpredictability in the outcome of the upcoming SEC appeal. In the interim, SEC’s Chair, Gary Gensler, has suggested that an appeal against the decision in the Ripple lawsuit is under strong consideration. While Gensler’s comment does not expressly guarantee an appeal, however; it indicates that the US SEC has not conceded a partial defeat in the suit.

As investors continue to take profit, a total of $107 million in outflows was recorded in the previous week. Crypto investment products listed in the report are from various exchange-traded product (ETP) providers, including 21Shares, Grayscale Investments, Bitwise, and Proshares. However, it was found that a significant portion of the outflows came from Purpose Investments and ETC Issuance. From a regional standpoint, CoinShares discovered that the outflows were mostly from Germany and Canada, which recorded $70.8 million and $28.5 million, respectively. Meanwhile, only Australia and the United States saw inflows, with $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Bitcoin Funds Record $111 Million In Weekly Outflows According to CoinShares’ head of research, James Butterfill, Bitcoin (BTC) was primarily responsible for the significant outflows registered by digital asset investment products in week 32 of 2023. The premier cryptocurrency saw total outflows of $111 million, its largest since March. Related Reading: Valkyrie Unveils Double-Barreled Approach To Launch An Ethereum ETF Alongside A Bitcoin ETF It appears that investment in Bitcoin-related funds is slowing down, as institutional investors continue to sell for profit. This latest report represents the third consecutive week in which Bitcoin funds experienced outflows totaling $139 million. Prior to this recent negative run, more than $742 million went into crypto funds over a four-week period, with Bitcoin receiving a huge chunk of that figure. This positive momentum is believed to have been spurred by Ripple’s partial victory over the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. CoinShares’ weekly report revealed that outflows into short Bitcoin have stopped for the first time in over three months. While this may suggest that institutional investors are no longer betting against the BTC price, the weekly outflows indicate that they are not banking on its rise either. For clarity, short products allow investors to profit when the price of a cryptocurrency – in this context, Bitcoin – falls. It typically involves borrowing Bitcoin, immediately selling it on the open market, and then buying it back at a lower price to repay the loan. As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $29,164, with a 0.5% price increase in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the cryptocurrency continues to lead the market with a market cap of roughly $567.3 billion. “Altcoins Sentiment Seems To Be Improving” While institutional investors continue to take profit from various Bitcoin-related funds, the signs seem positive for most altcoin investment products. According to CoinShares, altcoins (except Ethereum) recorded $3 million in outflows in week 31 of 2023. This trend appears to be gaining momentum, as Solana (SOL) particularly saw a substantial increase in buying pressure from institutions in Europe and the United States in week 32 of 2023. The cryptocurrency registered $9.5 million in weekly inflows, its highest figure since March 2020. Related Reading: Can Litecoin Bulls Turn The Tide On Recent Declines? A Closer Look Ripple (XRP) and Litecoin (LTC) also saw weekly inflows, recording $0.5 million and $0.46 million, respectively.
